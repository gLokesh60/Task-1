# Task-1
This project uses Linear Regression to predict house prices from the California housing dataset (housing.csv).
It uses features like total_rooms, total_bedrooms, and median_income to predict median_house_value.
Run the script with Python after installing pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
The model outputs coefficients, RÂ² score, MSE, and a plot of actual vs predicted prices.
Make sure housing.csv is in the same directory.
Quick to run and easy to adapt for other regression tasks.
